<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hey, I am Yifan Chen, an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Mathematics (affiliate) at Hong Kong Baptist University. 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Department of Statistics, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2023, advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yunyangstat/">Yun Yang</a>. 
I fortunately work with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yunyangstat/">Yun Yang</a>, 
Prof. <a href="https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/rqzhu/">Ruoqing Zhu</a>, 
Prof. <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/hengji/">Heng Ji</a>,
and Prof. <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/jingrui-he/">Jingrui He</a> during my Ph.D. studies.
I also collaborated with Prof. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dilek-hakkani-tur-9517543/">Dilek Hakkani-Tur</a> at Amazon Alexa AI, and Dr. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/people/jie-chen">Jie Chen</a> at IBM Research.
Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Statistics from Fudan University in 2018, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/teacher/preview.aspx?UID=141685">Juan Shen</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/teacher/preview.aspx?UID=1859">Chenghong Zhang</a>.

# 💻 Research

I am broadly interested in the general area of **efficient machine learning**, aiming to understand the statistical structures of modern machine learning algorithms and apply these insights to real-world computational challenges.
I especially focus on <strong>non-parametric models</strong> and neural networks with intensive matrix operations, such as <strong>Transformers</strong> (language models) and graph neural networks (<strong>GNNs</strong>).


# 🕮 Teaching

## Spring 25, Spring 24: COMP 7070 Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Overall, this course is an invitation to core machine learning for **AI application research**. It aims to familiarize the students with useful concepts in machine learning, and therefore to benefit their own research.

> Studies related to machine learning is implicitly divided into three genres in this statement: learning theory, core machine learning, and AI application.

Scribed lecture notes can be found on [this page](/teaching.html).

## Fall 24: COMP 2027 Applied Linear Algebra for Computing
