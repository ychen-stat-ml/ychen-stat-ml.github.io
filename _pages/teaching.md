# COMP 7070 Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Overall, this course is an invitation to core machine learning for **AI application research**. It aims to familiarize the students with useful concepts in machine learning, and therefore to benefit their own research.

> Studies related to machine learning is implicitly divided into three genres in this statement: learning theory, core machine learning, and AI application.

## Detailed course topics

- "Linearity is all you need"
    - Matrix derivative
    - Basic concepts of numerical analysis
    - Logistic regression
    - Basic concepts of convex optimization (convergence rate of GD and SGD) 


- Harness the power of randomness
    - SubGaussian random variables
    - Concentration inequalities
    - Sketching methods
    - Complexity of function class
    - Error decomposition (approximation, optimization, and generalization)

- Advanced topics
    - Kernel tricks and RKHS
    - Neural tangent kernels
    - Generative modeling (MLE - EM algorithm - VI - VAE - GAN/WGAN - Flow - Diffusion)

Note that the detailed lecture schedule may change as the semester progresses, based on student interest.
